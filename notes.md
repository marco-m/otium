- add tests!!!
- // FIXME HACK USE PROPER ErrQuit sentinel instead!!!
- Look for various FIXME and TODO
- add command "variables" to show the contents of the Bag
- uniform wrap all io.EOF and, simplify logic around all io.EOF and especially use errors.Is(err, io.ERR) to allow the wrapping
- replace fmt.Fprintln(pcd.Stdout, ...) with pcd.Println(...)
- look at all print functions and make them uniform
  - this should also add a prefix with the step name or similar? mhh too long... 
- check that no two steps have the same Title
- probably remove kong to parse the REPL, keep it to parse the program itself?
- support [checkpoints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_checkpointing)? To allow re-running the procedure without starting from scratch, if something in-between went wrong?
